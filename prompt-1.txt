Nice — I’ll treat the video’s project-first / vertical-slice approach as the guiding principle and give you a practical, implementable plan to build an internal LMS from the ground up. I’ll decompose the work into independent vertical slices you can deliver incrementally, include APIs, DB model, ADRs, CI/CD, testing, deployment, security, monitoring, and a recommended tech stack (lean and enterprise options). At the end I’ll list concrete next steps and offer to generate starter code for the stack you pick.

Big idea (in one line)

Build the LMS as a set of small, independently deliverable vertical slices (end-to-end features: UI + backend + DB + tests + CI + deploy + monitoring) so you can ship working value fast and iterate.

⸻

1) Vertical-slice decomposition (6–8 slices — deliver each in ~1–2 sprints)

Each slice is a small, testable product you can demo.
	1.	User auth & org model — sign up, SSO, roles, orgs, simple profile.
	•	Acceptance: user can sign in, join org, view profile.
	•	Key APIs: POST /auth/login, /auth/sso, GET /users/me.
	•	DB tables: users, orgs, user_org_roles, sessions.
	2.	Course catalogue & enrollment — create courses, search, enroll.
	•	Acceptance: admin creates course; a user enrolls and sees it in dashboard.
	•	APIs: GET /courses, POST /courses, POST /courses/{id}/enroll.
	•	DB: courses, course_versions, enrollments.
	3.	Content authoring & versioned lessons — WYSIWYG + content blocks (video, text, quiz).
	•	Acceptance: author can create a lesson with video + quiz; content is versioned and previewable.
	•	DB: lessons, modules, content_blocks, assets (S3 refs).
	4.	Player & learning progress — playback, analytics pings, resume, progress per lesson.
	•	Acceptance: learner resumes where they left off; progress stored and visible.
	•	APIs: POST /progress, GET /progress; events stream for analytics.
	5.	Assessments & grading — quizzes (MCQ, short answer), auto-grade, rubric for manual grading.
	•	Acceptance: learner takes quiz; auto-graded; grade saved to transcript.
	•	DB: quiz_questions, quiz_attempts, grades, rubrics.
	6.	Reports & admin dashboard — completion reports, learner activity, export CSV.
	•	Acceptance: admin downloads completion & engagement report.
	•	APIs: GET /reports/completion, /reports/engagement.
	7.	Integrations & standards — SSO (SAML/OIDC), xAPI (or optional SCORM wrapper), HRIS sync, calendar.
	•	Acceptance: users can SSO; xAPI statements emitted to LRS.
	8.	Ops: CI/CD, infra, monitoring & backups — deployment pipelines, automated tests, metrics, alerts.
	•	Acceptance: master -> staging -> prod pipeline; health checks + alerts.

2) Minimal viable data model (core tables — simplified)
	•	users(id, email, name, hashed_password, created_at, last_seen)
	•	orgs(id, name, settings)
	•	user_org_roles(user_id, org_id, role)
	•	courses(id, org_id, title, description, state, created_at)
	•	course_versions(id, course_id, version_number, published_at)
	•	modules(id, course_version_id, title, order)
	•	lessons(id, module_id, title, content_json, order)
	•	content_assets(id, lesson_id, type, url, metadata)
	•	enrollments(id, user_id, course_version_id, enrolled_at, status)
	•	progress(id, user_id, lesson_id, percent_complete, updated_at)
	•	quiz_questions(id, lesson_id, type, payload)
	•	quiz_attempts(id, user_id, quiz_id, answers_json, score, status, submitted_at)
	•	activity_log(id, user_id, event_type, metadata_json, created_at)

(Keep content JSON flexible so you can support rich block-based lessons.)

3) APIs — example endpoints (REST/GraphQL)
	•	Auth: POST /auth/login, POST /auth/refresh, POST /auth/sso/callback
	•	Users: GET /users/me, PUT /users/me
	•	Courses: GET /courses, GET /courses/{id}, POST /courses
	•	Enrollment: POST /courses/{id}/enroll, GET /users/{id}/enrollments
	•	Lessons: GET /lessons/{id}, POST /lessons, POST /lessons/{id}/preview
	•	Progress: POST /progress, GET /progress?user_id=..
	•	Quizzes: POST /quizzes/{id}/attempt, GET /quizzes/{id}/results
	•	Reports: GET /reports/completion?course_id=..

Consider GraphQL for flexible client queries but start REST for simplicity.

4) Architecture & infrastructure (two recommended stacks)

Lean / MVP
	•	Backend: Node.js + Express (or NestJS) or Python FastAPI
	•	Frontend: React + Vite
	•	DB: PostgreSQL
	•	Cache: Redis (sessions, rate-limits)
	•	Storage: S3-compatible (assets)
	•	Auth: OIDC (Auth0 or internal Keycloak)
	•	Deploy: Docker + DigitalOcean / Render / Heroku
	•	CI: GitHub Actions

Enterprise / Scalable
	•	Backend: Go or Java (Spring Boot) microservices (or modular monolith)
	•	Frontend: React (mono-repo with NX)
	•	DB: PostgreSQL primary, read replicas
	•	Event bus: Kafka or managed pub/sub (for analytics & async)
	•	Storage: S3
	•	Infra: Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS)
	•	Observability: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK or Datadog
	•	CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI + ArgoCD for GitOps
	•	LRS: Learning Record Store for xAPI statements

Start lean and evolve to enterprise patterns once usage grows.

5) How to apply the video’s principles (practical translation)
	1.	Project-first scope — choose one vertical slice (e.g., Course Catalog + Enrollment) and deliver end-to-end value before splitting horizontally.
	2.	Ship a working demo each sprint — always have a demoable product, even if limited.
	3.	Contracts & stubs — define API contracts early and use mocks so frontend and backend can be developed in parallel.
	4.	Lightweight docs & ADRs — capture major decisions in ADRs; keep docs tied to code (docs-as-code).
	5.	Iterate on operability — include logging & simple metrics on day one; you’ll learn by operating early.
	6.	Test boundaries — integration tests for slices, contract tests for APIs, end-to-end smoke tests.

⸻

6) Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — examples to create early
	•	ADR-0001: Monolith vs Modular Service — decision + trade-offs
	•	ADR-0002: Authentication — choose OIDC vs SAML vs in-house
	•	ADR-0003: Data model versioning and content schema (JSON blocks)
	•	ADR-0004: xAPI vs SCORM support
	•	ADR-0005: Deploy model (single service vs k8s)

Template: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives considered, Date, Authors.

⸻

7) QA & testing strategy
	•	Unit tests for business logic (server + client).
	•	Contract tests (Pact) between frontend and backend.
	•	Integration tests for each vertical slice (db + api).
	•	End-to-end smoke tests for critical flows (enroll -> take lesson -> progress).
	•	Load test reporting endpoints and publishing flows.
	•	Security scans (SAST) in CI.

⸻

8) CI/CD & release policy
	•	Branching: trunk-based or feature-branch with PRs.
	•	Pipelines:
	•	PR → unit tests, lint, contract tests, build artifacts.
	•	Merge to main → integration tests → deploy to staging.
	•	Manual promote → production once smoke tests pass.
	•	Use infra-as-code (Terraform) for repeatability.

⸻

9) Observability, SLOs, backups
	•	Metrics: request latency, error rate, daily active learners, enrollments/day.
	•	Logs: structured JSON logs, centralized logging.
	•	Traces: instrument key endpoints (sign-in, submit quiz, save progress).
	•	SLO examples: 99.9% uptime for auth; <200ms median read latency for catalogue.
	•	Backups: automated DB snapshots, daily asset backups.

⸻

10) Security & compliance
	•	Sensitive data: minimal retention of PII; encrypt at rest and in transit.
	•	RBAC for admin endpoints.
	•	Audit logs for content changes and grading.
	•	SSO + MFA for admins.
	•	GDPR/Privacy considerations for user data exports & deletion.

⸻

11) UX and product considerations
	•	Mobile-friendly learner interface; minimal distraction for learning.
	•	Authoring UX: block-based editor and preview, version history, draft vs published.
	•	Progress visibility: transcripts for learners and org admins.
	•	Notifications: email + in-app for enrollment, deadlines, pass/fail.
	•	Accessibility basics (WCAG): keyboard nav, alt text, transcripts for video.

⸻

12) Roadmap & timeline (example, 8 weeks)

Week 0: Kickoff — goals, ADRs, infra setup, repo scaffolding.
Weeks 1–2: Slice 1 — Auth + Org model (deliverable: login + org signup + demo).
Weeks 3–4: Slice 2 — Course catalog + enrollment + basic dashboard.
Weeks 5–6: Slice 3 — Content authoring + lesson render + progress events.
Week 7: Slice 4 — Quizzes + grading + basic report.
Week 8: Harden + ops + monitoring + final demo.
(Adjust to 2-week sprints and double down on slices you value most.)

⸻

13) Acceptance criteria checklist (for every slice)
	•	UI: usable and mobile-responsive.
	•	Backend: documented API + automated tests.
	•	DB: migrations + seeded test data.
	•	CI: pipeline runs and passes automatically.
	•	Observability: key metric and at least one alert configured.
	•	Security: basic auth + role-based access control in place.

⸻

14) Deliverables I can create for you right away

Pick one and I’ll produce it next:
	1.	Starter repo (monorepo) for chosen stack: auth, courses API, simple React UI, GitHub Actions.
	2.	Full set of ADRs and decision doc.
	3.	Detailed lesson-by-lesson vertical-slice backlog (ready for sprint planning).
	4.	Authoring UI spec + content JSON schema + sample lesson export (xAPI-ready).
	5.	Admin report templates and SQL queries for exports.

⸻

Next step (tell me one thing)

Tell me:
	•	which deliverable above you want first (1–5), and
	•	which stack you prefer: Lean (Node/React/Postgres) or Enterprise (K8s/Java/Go + Kafka), and
	•	whether you need xAPI/SCORM compatibility or not.

If you want, I’ll immediately generate a starter repo scaffold (option 1) for the chosen stack with one complete vertical slice (Auth + Course Catalog + Enrollment) — ready to clone and run.
